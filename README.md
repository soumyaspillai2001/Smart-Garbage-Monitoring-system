# Smart-Garbage-Monitoring-system
I have created a Smart Garbage Segregation and Monitoring System which is an autonomous system it segregates the waste into 2 categories dry and wet and is collected in separate bins. The Garbage level in bins are monitored and SMS Alert is sent to user once dustbin is full.The alerts continue until user empties the bin. User can empty the bin on time to avoid overflowing of garbage and littering of premises.
